#### Machine Learning course about End-to-end solution

In this training we will create an end-to-end solution, from data acquisition to the implementation of the Machine Learning model in a testing environment.

We will use the following frameworks:

- Pandas;

- Numpy;

- Matplotlib;

- Seaborn;

- Flask;

-Requests;

-Sklearn;

-Yellowbrick;

- Between others.

How will our dynamics work?

We will create an API in a testing environment, using the Flask framework to include our Machine Learning model in it, so we will make the request via Request and return the model's prediction.



Let's create a model using real estate data

Let's create an API using Flask

Let's structure the application infrastructure

Note: This solution can be adapted to create a data-based product or service.



Why learn to create solutions?
Programming is a completely practical discipline, so just reading books and/or watching videos does not develop all the necessary skills.

The demand for Python programmers has never been higher, after all, Python is one of the most used languages ​​in the world and a requirement for working with Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In fact, we can consider Python as a standard language for data analysis, given its broad ecosystem of libraries, which range from data manipulation and processing to even model deployment. We cannot forget, in this sense, that Python is a general application language.

As it is a versatile programming language, simple to learn and very powerful, Python has features that, despite being simple to use, make learning very fun.
